# ML Platform Example

This is a repository focused on building an ML platform from scratch. The repository relies heavily on (and copies code) [this repo](https://github.com/aporia-ai/mlplatform-workshop). The repository is fantastic and it comes with workshop videos! The purpose of *this* repository is to familiarize myself with what was built in that repository and extend the work further to help others build a robust production ml platform.

To extend this project, I will be building an NLP platform.
