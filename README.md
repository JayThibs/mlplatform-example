# ML Platform Example

This is a repository focused on building an ML platform from scratch. The repository relies heavily on [this repo](https://github.com/aporia-ai/mlplatform-workshop). The purpose of *this* repository is to familiarize myself with what was built in that repository and extend the work further to help others build a robust production ml platform.
